# pagerank_with_sparse_matrix_support
In this assignment the PageRank algorithm has been implemented in Python. PageRank is used to rank websites in search results. It works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.
